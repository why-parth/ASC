Compile face.c and then pass is code.f (or any other file you want to read).

The reading process depends upon the file "dev.c", face.exe compiles the reader as per dev.c's development.

code.f will be red and specific functions will be called,
for example, the file "example_dev-read_blocks_and_instructions.c" can be used by copy-pasting the code from this file to the file "dev.c".
Or, by going into the file "reader.c" and re-defining src as "example_dev-read_blocks_and_instructions.c".

Feel free to explore this code.
